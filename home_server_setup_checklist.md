# Home Server Setup Checklist

I'm not gonna get into the tech details, instead I'll write it all as little stories and detail the implementations once the are in place:

- [] Should be able to ssh from the internet of things
- [] Should have the same terminal I am using in my laptop
- [] Should be able to start torrent downloads
- [] Should be able to stream video/audio
- [] Should be able to sync self-snapshot to an Glacier bucket for backups
- [] Should be able to run virtual boxes with Ubuntu, Windows, Mac OS, and SmartOS

That's all I need for now.
