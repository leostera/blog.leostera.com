# NodIX
Some ramblings on a node.js powered operating system. The idea would be to support asynchronicity and non-blocking I/O from the lowest level. I'm definitely not that savvy on operating systems, but it'd be a very interesting experiment (however successful).

## Motivation
* Gain deeper understanding of how does an OS work
* Gain proficiency in JavaScripting
* Maybe do something that I can use to deploy my projects on (baking an AMI first)
