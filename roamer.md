Why do all the static site generators out there need to be so complicated and just abuse preprocessors and so many things? It could be really as easy as dropping your .md files in a posts folder and running a one command.

No jade, no coffee, no nothing. ~~Maybe some LESS, but nothing more~~ not even some LESS.

It annoys me that the only options out there seem to have a lot of stuff integrated yet produce very basic results.

I want a static site generator where:

1. I only need to worry about writing markdown.
2. Can have themes I can switch with a flag.f

It should produce just raw HTML that will fit in a template.

## I only need to worry about writing markdown
There. I said it. I couldn't care less about your expressive jade templating, or your awesome plugin system. I'm trying to write a very straightforward blog in plain markdown and *just perhaps* throw in a nice theme.

## Can have themes I can switch with a flag
Themes. Easily installable, easily tweakable. Themes. Easily interchangeable.
