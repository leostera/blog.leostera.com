# Some ideas I want to put together this year

## Apartment over time (alias El Vigilante) – 4,000 ARS
* Get a GoPro – 3700 ARS
* Get a wall mount support – 300 ARS
* Make a script that takes a picture of my studio apartment from a good angle every 12 hours or so
* Upload pictures to S3 – negligible cost
* Every month make a film with those pictures to see how has my apartment changed over time

## Game center – min 5,300 ARS; max 6,200 ARS
* Buy a Raspberry PI – 600 ARS
* Get MAME/SNES/SEGA/Playstation emulators running smoooothly
* Get a couple xbox 360 wireless controllers – 400 ARS / each
* Get powerful (3A) USB Hub – 300 ARS
* Get a TV – 4,000 ARS
* Profit!

## Media center – 3,000 ARS
* Just get a goddamned Apple TV and hook it up to the TV. – 1,300 ARS
* Get a nice set of speakers. – 1,700 ARS

## 3D Printer – no clue
* Need to research more on [RepRap.org](http://reprap.org/wiki/The_incomplete_reprap_beginner%27s_guide) and on [AppSpot's RepRapBook](https://reprapbook.appspot.com)

## Home cluster – min 1,000 ARS; max 16,000
* 2^n node Raspberry PI cluster clocking over 32GHz – 500 ARS per node
* Web-interface (home.leostera.com)
* Services should include:
    * lights control,
    * game center control,
    * media center control,
    * AC control,
    * El Vigilante control,
    * weather reports,
    * sleeping cycle reports,
    * daily backups 
    * push-notifications to my phone
* Built in erlang, node, and python
* Adding microphones around the room would support good voice recognition for Voice Command.
* 3 Terabyte RAID 0 system
