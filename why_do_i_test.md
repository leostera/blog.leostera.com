# Why do I test
Man, every time I think about testing I just, I...sorry, it's hard to explain how much I hate the idea of testing. I do not know why. Maybe because the setup is always a pain in the ass, maybe because you have to properly understand your code and your application's design to know what you need to test and how, maybe because you don't know there are tools out there to help you make fixtures.

Bull. Roar.

We are all dumbasses that write ugly, opinionated, often poorly optimized or barely legible code. The reason we don't test is because it hurts our feelings, not because it's hard to setup or because we don't get our application (well, maybe this happens sometimes, but *of course not to me! I don't test because I know how my application works in all edge cases*). That's probably another reason we don't lint our code enough.

## Then why do I test?
Because it hurts my feelings. And it hurts them because I was wrong. And it makes me less wrong to know I was wrong. And then I can write better programs. There, I said it.

Writing better programs hurt, and maybe it shouldn't, but is this *almighty hacker ego* that usually prevents us from getting there. From proving ourselves our creation sucks, well before it's too late and money has changed hands and the user complains.

That's the same reason I benchmark. What's really the limit of my programs?

## Stop reading. Go get a can of Redbull. Start testing.
That's about the size of it.
